                <p>Salam. I am Abu Bakar Mohammad Ali. Like others students I have also read an essay 'Aim in Life'. But to gain success in life depends on some subjects. Such as honesty, industry, punctuality etc. Only by dint of hard work one can not gain success in life. I strongly believe that <b>Honesty is the best policy ever in the world</b> and <b>Courtest costs nothing but buys everything.</b> So my approach is to become a tech expert by working hard honestly.</p>
